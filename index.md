Being a graduate in Data science for Public Policy program at the Hertie School of Governance my professional journey has evolved from interdisciplinary Data science and Analytics into AI consultancy, with a specialization in AI governance and related regulations. I am passionate about helping organizations strategize trust in AI across industries and always open to meaningful conversations at the intersection of Technology, Policy, and Ethics.
