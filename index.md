Hello there 👋!

I am a Computer engineer from the [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.pict.edu), Maharashtra, India pursuing a social impact career. Being a graduate in [Data science for Public Policy](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds) program at the Hertie School of Governance [my professional journey](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hertie-school-india-hub_adrcon-activity-7336024134637842432-WVSi?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABSRwoYB6fqgqhqI_zXs69uoOnef-XWd2w4) has evolved from interdisciplinary Data science and Analytics into AI consultancy, with a specialization in AI governance and related regulations. AI is transformative and I am interested in helping organizations strategize trust in AI across industries. I am always open to meaningful conversations at the intersection of Technology, Policy, and Ethics.
